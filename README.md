# TITLE: TRAILFLIX
This project is the implementation of a web-based media viewing application. PostgreSQL is used to implement the database. React.js has been used as the frontend technology along with node.js in the backend.

# Register/Login: 
The user has to register for the application when they use the application first. While registering the user has three choices for the subscription plan. From the next time, the user can simply login by providing their username and password credentials. The database is checked for the login credentials which the user has entered, and if it exists, the user is allowed to login or else they are prompted to try again.  
Homepage:
Once the user has successfully logged in/registered, they are redirected to the homepage. In the homepage, the thumbnails of all the movies existing in the database is displayed, ordered by their respective genre. The user also has the option to add their own movies to the database through the add movie page.

# Video Player Page:

When the thumbnail of a movie is clicked, the user is redirected to the video player page where the corresponding video plays. Below the video player, the user can also see the details of the movie such as ratings, description of the movie, date of release, as well as the actors who acted in the movie and the details of the director who directed the movie. The user also has the facility to add comments about the video they are watching below the video player. Once posted, other users can also view what they have written.
